# Unreal Engine Developer Course - Section 4 - Battle Tank

Bonjour!
If you came to this repo, you're probably looking for the TankHoverThruster component.
It's meant to be used as a Scene Component, attached to a static mesh parent with a socket called "HoverThruster".
Damping, Gain, and Desired Height can be tuned from there. Enjoy!
